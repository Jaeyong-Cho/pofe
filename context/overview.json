    "project_summary": "This project is an AI-powered code analysis tool designed to analyze and summarize the structure and functionality of software projects. It uses Python with the 'pofe' package as its core framework, leveraging AI models to identify key files, generate detailed file summaries, and produce an overall project overview in JSON format. The tool's workflow is orchestrated through main.py, configured via pyproject.toml, and structured using context/overview.json to manage analysis tasks and results.",

        "main.py": "This file serves as the entry point for a code analysis tool that uses AI models to understand and summarize a project's structure and files. It orchestrates running commands to gather project information, querying AI models to identify key files, and generating summaries of those files. The tool then compiles an overall project summary and stores the results in a JSON file.",
        "pyproject.toml": "This file defines the project metadata, including the package name, version, Python version requirements, and optional dependencies for the 'pofe' application. It specifies that the project requires Python 3.13 or higher and includes an optional dependency on 'ollama' for specific features. The configuration serves as a central point for managing project settings and external dependencies.",
        "context/overview.json": "This file contains the main entry point of the application and orchestrates the overall workflow by interacting with AI models to analyze the project structure, generate summaries of key files, and produce an overall project summary in JSON format."
